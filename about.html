<h3 class="about-page">Affiliate links</h3>
<p>PC Review uses affiliate links, so we may be paid a small commission from any purchase you make through some of the
    vendors we link to.</p>
<p>This doesn’t affect our editorial independence: these links are generated automatically by the site. Editors,
    journalists and reviewers are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PC Review receives from any
    purchase. Any recommendation (or criticism) is based on our experts believing that the product being reviewed is
    generally the best (or not the best) in its class.</p>
