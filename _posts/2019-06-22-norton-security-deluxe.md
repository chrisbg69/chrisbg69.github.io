Norton by Symantec is one of the most famous names in the antivirus industry. You'll find it among our pick of the best antivirus. We've been using the latest version of Norton Security Deluxe 2019 to bring you a full review of the latest security software.

As in previous years, Norton continues to make its "100% virus guarantee," promising that an expert will help keep your devices virus-free or your money back if you run into a particularly difficult piece of malware that overcomes its defences. This is a bold claim, and one only an established name such as Norton could feel confident in making. But does Security Deluxe have the tools to minimise the risk?

Deluxe isn't quite the top of the range Norton domestic antivirus product. That title goes to the Premium offering, which protects 10 devices, offers 25GB of online storage, and parental control tools. If you want something more stripped down, there's always the Standard version, which protects just one device and just includes a firewall and antivirus modules.

The price of Norton Security Deluxe's protection weighs in at £69.99 for up to five devices including PC, Mac, iOS and Android, though hefty discounts are available throughout the year from the Norton website so it's worth a check even if the RRP is out of your budget. That will get you one year of protection, after which you will need to renew. You can choose to sign up for two years at £89.99.

Internally, Norton's antivirus products benefit from technology and cloud support provided by parent company Symantec, including SONAR Protection. This detects malware by examining the behaviour of running applications. The dedicated Intrusion Prevention module also blocks attacks from infected computers connected to your network. This is particularly welcome given the increasing amount of malware seeking to spread to other local computers after an initial infection.

In terms of configuration, plenty of options usually means plenty of confusion, but here everything is laid out in a logical manner, with simple on/off switched, and help is available for every setting.

The app version (Norton Mobile Security and Antivirus) runs on iOS and Android. This contains the essential modules you need, and nothing you'll never use. Along with antivirus and anti-theft, there are modules for web protection, privacy and WiFi security.

Possibly because of a lack of extraneous modules and options, the mobile app is a terse affair, especially when viewed on a tablet where each screen contains little text and small icons.
