InMotion is a US-based web hosting provider that has been around for almost two decades. Take a look at its website and you might be instantly put off by its stark business look. It’s certainly not aimed at beginners and won’t hold your hand through the process of choosing a package.

The website builder tool is included free and you get a free domain name too. If you have an existing site, you can migrate that to InMotion easily, and again freely.

Prices start from $3.99 per month (approximately £3.21) for the Launch plan and that comes with unlimited storage, bandwidth, email and allows you to have two websites among other features. This includes a discount for signing up for two years, but there’s a 90-day money-back guarantee if you’re unhappy with what you’ve bought.

For twice the server performance, you’ll need the Power package, which costs $5.99 per month (around £4.82) and also adds ecommerce support. If you’re after twice the performance again and “pro-level” support, then the Pro package costs $13.99 per month (about £11.25). Again, these are all prices for two-year plans, billed up front.

Signing up with InMotion initially gets you several emails and that turns out to be a good thing as you’ve soon got everything you need to log in and start getting to grips with this website creation service. And, for additional comfort and convenience you’ll find that InMotion not only caters for the start-up individual but also offers a raft of other features, functions and services that allow you to scale any kind of project upwards until it has pages that run into the thousands.

While the InMotion site is less simplistic and, in some respects, could prove a little more daunting than some of the very basic-looking hosts out there, you can’t really knock it for the level of information and support that’s available.

Everything is here although you might just have to look a little bit harder to find it. On top of that, of course, you can also get in touch with support staff (who work 24/7) and we also rather liked the look of the forum pages too. 

All in all then, InMotion is a promising and potent option for those who either have a WordPress site already or want to create one.
