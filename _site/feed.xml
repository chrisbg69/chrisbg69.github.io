You’ll find it among our pick of the best antivirus. We’ve been using the latest version of Norton Security Deluxe 2019 to bring you a full review of the latest security software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in previous years, Norton continues to make its “100% virus guarantee,” promising that an expert will help keep your devices virus-free or your money back if you run into a particularly difficult piece of malware that overcomes its defences. This is a bold claim, and one only an established name such as Norton could feel confident in making. But does Security Deluxe have the tools to minimise the risk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deluxe isn’t quite the top of the range Norton domestic antivirus product. That title goes to the Premium offering, which protects 10 devices, offers 25GB of online storage, and parental control tools. If you want something more stripped down, there’s always the Standard version, which protects just one device and just includes a firewall and antivirus modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of Norton Security Deluxe’s protection weighs in at £69.99 for up to five devices including PC, Mac, iOS and Android, though hefty discounts are available throughout the year from the Norton website so it’s worth a check even if the RRP is out of your budget. That will get you one year of protection, after which you will need to renew. You can choose to sign up for two years at £89.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, Norton’s antivirus products benefit from technology and cloud support provided by parent company Symantec, including SONAR Protection. This detects malware by examining the behaviour of running applications. The dedicated Intrusion Prevention module also blocks attacks from infected computers connected to your network. This is particularly welcome given the increasing amount of malware seeking to spread to other local computers after an initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of configuration, plenty of options usually means plenty of confusion, but here everything is laid out in a logical manner, with simple on/off switched, and help is available for every setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app version (Norton Mobile Security and Antivirus) runs on iOS and Android. This contains the essential modules you need, and nothing you’ll never use. Along with antivirus and anti-theft, there are modules for web protection, privacy and WiFi security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly because of a lack of extraneous modules and options, the mobile app is a terse affair, especially when viewed on a tablet where each screen contains little text and small icons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Norton by Symantec is one of the most famous names in the antivirus industry.

Take a look at its website and you might be instantly put off by its stark business look. It’s certainly not aimed at beginners and won’t hold your hand through the process of choosing a package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website builder tool is included free and you get a free domain name too. If you have an existing site, you can migrate that to InMotion easily, and again freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices start from $3.99 per month (approximately £3.21) for the Launch plan and that comes with unlimited storage, bandwidth, email and allows you to have two websites among other features. This includes a discount for signing up for two years, but there’s a 90-day money-back guarantee if you’re unhappy with what you’ve bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For twice the server performance, you’ll need the Power package, which costs $5.99 per month (around £4.82) and also adds ecommerce support. If you’re after twice the performance again and “pro-level” support, then the Pro package costs $13.99 per month (about £11.25). Again, these are all prices for two-year plans, billed up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing up with InMotion initially gets you several emails and that turns out to be a good thing as you’ve soon got everything you need to log in and start getting to grips with this website creation service. And, for additional comfort and convenience you’ll find that InMotion not only caters for the start-up individual but also offers a raft of other features, functions and services that allow you to scale any kind of project upwards until it has pages that run into the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the InMotion site is less simplistic and, in some respects, could prove a little more daunting than some of the very basic-looking hosts out there, you can’t really knock it for the level of information and support that’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is here although you might just have to look a little bit harder to find it. On top of that, of course, you can also get in touch with support staff (who work 24/7) and we also rather liked the look of the forum pages too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all then, InMotion is a promising and potent option for those who either have a WordPress site already or want to create one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">InMotion is a US-based web hosting provider that has been around for almost two decades.

It’s capable of speedy file transfers, and it’s certainly powerful enough to stream your music and videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also lets you set up a personal cloud, so you can access your files over the Internet from apps for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, as well as using a browser on your PC. The ReadyNAS 202 represents a good combination of convenience, speed, and value. As such, it is our Editors’ Choice for consumer/SOHO NAS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ReadyNAS 202 is sold diskless, so you’ll have to buy one or two NAS-optimized hard drives for the unit. I installed a pair of 6TB Hitachi Deskstar NAS drives in a RAID 1 array, which gave me a total of 6TB of protected storage for my testing, and they cost an extra $600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most NAS enclosures, the ReadyNAS 202 is designed for quick drive installation and replacement. The two drive sleds are tool-less, which means you don’t need a screwdriver. Just pop in an HDD using a pair of permanently-attached retracting rails built into each sled, and it automatically locks to the sled. The sleds can then slide home, and you can start your setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the NAS up was easy in testing. All I had to do was plug the ReadyNAS 202 into my router, turn it on, and visit Netgear’s ReadyNAS website on my test laptop. The website then connected to the ReadyNAS device on my LAN. I created a ReadyCloud account online when prompted, Netgear paired the NAS to my account, and then my NAS was ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Netgear ReadyNAS 202 is a top-notch consumer NAS that’s primed to back up your files and grant access to them from your PC or mobile device. It works seamlessly on your home network, and is easily accessible over the Internet via the ReadyCloud account and app. And the ReadyNAS 202 offers similar performance and hardware features as our former top pick for consumer/SOHO NAS, the QNAP TS-251, but for $100 less, so it’s our new Editors’ Choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Netgear ReadyNAS 202 ($298.99) is an economical, two-bay, network-attached storage (NAS) device that provides file sharing and backups over your home network.

Its Box device was the first to market, but not the last, and has since been joined by a burgeoning crowd of competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bitdefender maintains a competitive edge with a centralized approach to security that lets you protect PCs, mobile devices, and even IoT devices from within a single app interface. The new Bitdefender Box 2 is meant to be the center of your secure home, guarding against attacks on your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all such security devices, the price tag includes a subscription fee. After the first year, it costs $99 per year to continue using all the bells and whistles that come with the Box 2. That might sound like a lot, but it’s actually a pretty sweet deal, considering that you get unlimited access to the company’s software, which we discuss below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At close to $300, the Box 2 is definitely in the upper tier of routers, but it’s by no means at the top. The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 Smart Wi-Fi Router (R9000), for example, will set you back $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upright, fanless design lets air travel naturally through the Box 2. Peek through the grill on the top and you see little more than a single board inside the casing. Somewhere on that little board is a Dual Core Cortex A9 1.2GHz processor, with 1GB of DDR3 memory and 4GB of internal storage. The new Box supports concurrent dual-band wireless 2.4GHz and 5Hhz with MU-MIMO in a 3x3 antenna configuration. It supports IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wave-2 at AC1900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powered by a single AC jack, there are only two ports: one LAN port and one WAN port of the 10/100/1000 BaseT Ethernet variety. A small reset button lets you wipe the device, should you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we have tested all of the Box’s security features, we’re witholding a final score until its wireless networking abilities can be evaluated. This is the same process we’ve used for all such devices. We will update the story with a final score in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Just two years ago, antivirus company Bitdefender went in a new direction with a hardware solution for smart home security.

Acer’s Predator Orion 9000 made headlines thanks to its eye-catching design coupled with ultra-high-end components including processors with up to eighteen cores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy the Predator Orion 9000 directly from Acer’s website (currently on a waiting list). There are two models available, starting from £2,999 for the 6-core version and rising to a whopping £4,999 for the ten-core version with dual graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Acer Predator Orion 9000 is a huge, imposing beast of a PC both inside and out. Housed in Acer’s ‘monolithic’ custom-designed system case, the Orion 9000 features an angular space-age design with customisable RGB lighting, easily removable side panels and plenty of space inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so big and heavy that Acer has decided to fit it with a pair of wheels at the rear so you can lug it around behind you like a luggage trolley. It’s also fitted with two sturdy handles at the top to make it easier and safer to lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the front, there’s a handy pull-out bar purpose-built as a place to hang your gaming headphones. Acer has also thrown in a DVD RAM drive for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’d expect from a PC at this price point, the build quality is excellent, and because it’s designed entirely by Acer rather than built from off-the-shelf components, everything fits together perfectly, including the Predator Orion 9000’s custom-designed Icetunnel 2.0 cooling system which forms an integral part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icetunnel 2.0 maintains four distinct thermal zones within the case, separating off the power supply from the GPU, CPU and storage areas, each of which is delivered its own carefully controlled share of cool air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five RGB-illuminated 120mm fans are installed: one at the rear, two at the top and two more at the front of the case. The top two are fitted to the dual 120mm radiator forming part of a Predator-branded Cooler Master liquid processor cooler. There’s plenty of additional RGB lighting throughout the case which can easily be configured to your own preferred colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At launch, the Predator Orion 9000’s headline-grabbing specs included support for Core i7 and Core i9 Processors, including Intel’s Extreme Edition 18-core Core i9-7980XE chip. However, only two versions of the PC are being made available in the UK, neither of which supports this flagship CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you can opt for the 6-core 3.5GHz Core i7-7800X in the entry-level system or the 10-core 3.30 GHz Core i9-7900X in the high-end version. Don’t worry, though, both of these processors are quite bonkers enough for a gaming PC, as you can see in our performance evaluation below.
Storage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less expensive model comes with a 2TB hard drive and a 256GB SSD preinstalled, which increases to 4TB and 512GB respectively if you opt for the pricier system. There’s plenty of room for additional storage in the case too, with room for up to six drives in total.
Motherboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom-designed for the Predator Orion 9000, the Acer PO9-900 motherboard isn’t one you can buy off-the-shelf, and no detailed list of specs is provided either. However, the key features are an Intel X299 Express chipset to handle the Skylake-X processors and eight RAM slots, supporting up to 128GB of DDR4 in total (of which 16GB or 32GB is installed at purchase time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also includes three M.2 slots, Gigabit ethernet, Wireless-AC Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 Sound is provided by on-board Sound BlasterX Pro surround gaming audio engine. You also get four x16 PCI Express slots, which brings us on to…
Graphics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK the entry-level model comes fitted with a GTX 1080 TI, although there’s plenty of room to double up to a multi-card configuration as found in the high-end version which comes with dual GTX 1080 TI cards as standard. At launch, the PC was shown with up to four Radeon Vega 64 cards installed but, like the 18-core version, this configuration doesn’t look likely to appear in the UK.
Performance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the test results, you should note that our review sample was built to a different specification than either of the models available in the UK. Our test configuration included the more expensive Core i9-7900X processor but with a single GTX 1080 Ti graphics card rather than the twin cards found in the pricier model on Acer’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would, therefore, expect gaming performance to be at a similar level to the lower-end £2,999 system combined with general computing benchmark scores closer to the £4,999 system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Predator Orion 9000 includes some super-high-end hardware which, as you might imagine, delivers excellent performance for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s the extreme multi-tasking capability of the Core-i9 7900X which makes it so expensive, and this is of little real-world benefit when it comes to gaming. Even general- purpose benchmarks show minimal advantages outside of specialist applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to play games while rendering 4K video at the same time, then that might be a different matter, but for the vast majority of gamers, this PC is an expensive luxury.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Announced in the middle of last year, but only now becoming available to buy in the UK.

You’ll need to buy it direct from PC Specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of power for this price, and it squares up well against its key rival. The Overclockers Hoplite originally arrived at £1,479, but now it costs £1,299 – so it’s £100 cheaper than the PC Specialist machine. That rig relies on an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X CPU and RTX 2060 graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vulcan S2 is protected by the standard PC Specialist deal, which is a three-year labour deal with one year of parts protection and one month of collection coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our best gaming PC chart.
Design &amp;amp; Build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC Specialist has used one of its own enclosures for this machine. It’s called the PCS P209, and it nails most of the current trends. There’s a tempered glass side panel, a magnetic dust filter on top, and a slab of metal at the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like loads of other recent cases – including the Kolink Phalanx RGB used by the Overclockers Hoplite. That PC’s enclosure also has a tempered glass side panel and a dust filter in the roof, but its front-mounted trio of RGB LED fans are more eye-catching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC Specialist Vulcan S2 case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The P209 is 455mm tall and 390mm deep, so it’s smaller than the Kolink – that unit is 510mm talk and 445mm deep. That bodes well for fitting the Vulcan into smaller spaces. Build quality is impressive, too – the steel used throughout is sturdy, so we have no concerns there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are slim air intake vents at the front, and at the rear there’s a 120mm exhaust. Air intake is handled by two 120mm fans that are attached to the Cooler Master MasterLiquid Lite 240 processor cooler. That’s a slight concern – because it means that cool air coming in will immediately be heated. This shouldn’t be a huge problem due to the Vulcan’s mid-range components, but the Overclockers is better-equipped due to its trio of intake fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top of the P209 only has two USB 2.0 ports and one USB 3.0 connection – there’s no faster USB 3.1 port. It’s the same as the Kolink case, but it’s not particularly good for fast data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the inside the P209 remains conventional. A PSU shroud hides the Corsair power supply, and PC Specialist has done a good job of keeping cables neat – so airflow isn’t disrupted and internal access is easy. Lighting is handled by a patterned strip of RGB LEDs down the front panel and a strip of lights to illuminate the hardware inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in some areas the P209 is basic. Behind the motherboard there’s only room to add single 2.5- and 3.5in hard disks, and the hard disk option is poor – there’s no dedicated bay and no tool-free installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC Specialist Vulcan S2 ports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hoplite’s Kolink case is better here, with pairs of 2.5- and 3.5in hard disk bays. That case also has 370mm of graphics card clearance – 50mm more than the PCS P209.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vulcan’s case is smart, sturdy, small and accessible, and it has RGB LEDs. But it doesn’t have the best port selection, and the slightly cheaper Overclockers has more room to grow – as well as more extravagant design.
Specs &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 sits in the middle of Nvidia’s latest range. It uses the Turing architecture, which means you get the latest architectural improvements – as well as ray-tracing and DLSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vulcan’s RTX 2070 is made by Palit, and it uses the GPU’s stock configuration with no overclocking. That means you get 2,304 stream processors, 8GB of memory and a boost clock of 1,620MHz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of overclocking doesn’t stop the RTX 2070 outstripping the cheaper Overclockers’ RTX 2060. The Gigabyte-made card in that machine has a small overclock, with the 1,680MHz standard turbo speed improved to 1,770MHz, but that GPU only has 1,920 stream processors and 6GB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC Specialist Vulcan S2 Nvidia RTX 2070&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the RTX 2070 was better in our benchmarks. Its Sky Diver result of 44,637 is more than 1,000 points ahead of the Hoplite. The PC Specialist handled Total War: Warhammer 2 at 1080p and Ultra settings at 152fps – five frames ahead of the Hoplite. At Ultra the Vulcan ran at 91fps – a four-frame advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tougher Ghost Recon: Wildlands, at 1080p and at Ultra settings, the Vulcan still blasted through with an average of 65fps – easily playable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vulcan played games at 1440p, too: in Warhammer and Ghost Recon at maximum settings it averaged 62- and 51fps respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RTX 2070 can’t handle 4K, though. It only managed good framerates at Medium settings – at Ultra, in both games, minimum framerates dipped below 30fps. You’re either going to get stuttering gameplay or you’ll have to drop the quality levels, and neither is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This £1,394 machine is built around two key components: an Intel Core i7-9700 processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card.

That’s all the more reason to to be excited about the MateBook 13, which brings the same style at a friendlier price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced at CES 2019, the MateBook 13 looks an awful lot like the X and X Pro - with a few compromises, to be fair - but shaves a few hundred off the price, turning it into a competitive rival to the likes of the MacBook Air or the new Dell XPS 13 and potentially one of the best laptops of 2019.
Price and availability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MateBook 13 is out now, and comes in two models - with specs varying slightly between regions. In the UK, the base model is £899 (available from Amazon or Currys) and comes with a Core i5 processor and 256GB of storage. The higher end model - the one we were given to review - costs £1099 (from Amazon, Currys, Very, Argos, or AO) and includes a faster i7 processor and double the storage, 512GB. Both models have the same 8GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specs in the US are almost the same. The base model is the same - a Core i5 processor and 256GB storage, though it comes in a silver finish - and will cost you $999 (from Amazon, B&amp;amp;H, or Newegg), but the pricier version is a little different. In addition to the i7 processor and 512GB storage, the US model includes an Nvidia MX150 graphics card for $1299 (from Amazon, B&amp;amp;H, or Newegg).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the MacBook Air starts from £1,199/$1,199 for a model with less storage than Huawei’s, while the XPS 13 starts from £999/$899 for an i3 processor, that pricing is already seriously competitive, and anyone looking for a compact, portable laptop around that price point should at least be considering the MateBook 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple-ish aesthetics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen any of Huawei’s recent laptops then the MateBook 13 will appear immediately familiar. There’s the same grey finish (with silver on the cheaper American model), with minimal bezels, an expansive touchpad, and all-metal construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will probably also appear familiar if you’ve seen Apple’s latest MacBook and MacBook Air, and it’d be hard not to admit that Huawei’s designers owe a debt to Apple’s. That’s partly what will fuel the inevitable comparisons to the new Air, and the MateBook comes out surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13in, 2160 x 1440 touchscreen display is in the same 3:2 aspect ratio Huawei’s favoured for a few years. It’s a squarer, boxier format than you might be used to, which results in a lot of letter-boxing when you watch movies or TV, but leaves you with plenty of vertical screen real estate when you’re working or browsing the web. That makes it ideal as a work device, if less optimal for curling up in bed with Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyboard is pretty lovely, with comfortable key spacing and a really responsive, short action. These are very low-profile keys, which might take a little getting used to for some, but undeniably easy to type on. The trackpad is a bit less appealing - the size is great, but there’s a very slight stickiness to it, with just a bit too much drag for my liking. It feels slightly wrong to me, in a way that’s hard to pin down, and I’d recommend trying to check the laptop out in person if you can to make sure it won’t bother you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Huawei’s MateBook X and MateBook X Pro are some of the best looking laptops on the market, but they each came with a few compromises - and hefty price tags. That’s all the more reason to to be excited about the MateBook 13, which brings the same style at a friendlier price.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Razer Blade Pro 17</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/laptops/razer-blade-pro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Razer Blade Pro 17" /><published>2019-03-03T15:56:05+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-03T15:56:05+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/laptops/razer-blade-pro</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/laptops/razer-blade-pro/">&lt;p&gt;Not long ago gaming laptops were big, bulky beasts that were more akin to a portable PC tower than a sexy, sleek laptop. However, companies like Razer have made leaps and bounds in the laptop design department over the past few years and now offer products that are both powerful and sleek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Razer’s Blade Pro 17 is the company’s top-of-the-line 17.3in laptop for gamers, offering desktop-level graphics in a chassis that’s not only 25 percent thinner than its predecessor, but small enough to fit in most 15in laptop bags too. Is it enough to solidify its place amongst the best gaming laptops available? We think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent some time gaming on the Razer Blade Pro 17, and here’s our full review.
Blade Pro 17 - Price &amp;amp; Availability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you thought the £1,699/$1,899 starting price of the standard Razer Blade 15 was high, you might wince at the £2,399/$2,499 starting price for the Razer Blade Pro. It doesn’t end there either, as you can pick up the mid-range model for £2,679/$2,799 and the high-end model for £3,079/$3,199.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those interested in buying the Razer Blade Pro 17 can do so from Razer along with the likes of Amazon, Scan and Currys PC World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-end price tag puts it in direct competition not only with Razer’s own high-end Blade 15 (2019), but the likes of the Alienware Area 51M (from £1,948) and budget-friendly Aorus 15 X9 (from £1,999).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the Razer Blade Pro 17 pricing to give you a better idea of what’s on offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;144Hz FHD display, 16GB RAM, 512GB, RTX 2060 – £2,399 / $2,499 / €2,669
144Hz FHD display, 16GB RAM, 512GB, RTX 2070 Max-Q – £2,679 / $2,799 / €3,049
144Hz FHD display, 16GB RAM, 512GB, RTX 2080 Max-Q – £3,079 / $3,199 / €3,499
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blade Pro 17 - Design &amp;amp; Build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 follows a similar design aesthetic to the rest of the Razer collection, including the Razer Blade 15 and even the Razer Phone 2, complete with a black-and-green colour scheme and a bold, angular design that looks sleek. It’s certainly a step away from the in-your-face gaming laptop design on offer by the likes of Alienware, with the understated Razer Blade Pro 17 looking just as good at the office as it does playing games at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chassis of the Razer Blade Pro 17 features an anodized matte black finish which in addition to looking good and keeping fingerprints at bay, helps the laptop stay scratch- and scuff-free, although we’re not in the position to start defacing it in the name of testing. It should also prove quite sturdy, as the entire chassis is milled from a single block of aluminium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite featuring a 17.3in display, the 0.6mm bezels that surround it allow the chassis to stay relatively small – in fact, the Razer Blade Pro 17 is 25% smaller than the last-gen Pro and boasts similar dimensions to 15in laptops we’ve used in the past, measuring in at 395 x 360 x 19.9mm and weighing 2.75kg. We can confirm that it’ll just about fit into a 15in laptop bag too, making it easier to transport between home and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the chassis magic, the Razer Blade Pro 17 has a larger surface for cooling when compared to the 2018 variant, which translates to better heat dissipation and better performance during long, intense gaming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blade Pro 17 - Specs &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like with the display, regardless of the model you choose, you’re going to get a 9th-gen six-core i7-9750H processor with a 2.6GHz base speed, boosted to 4.5GHz with Max Turbo. It’s the same story with RAM and storage, with all variants boasting 16GB Dual-Channel DDR4 2667MHz RAM and a 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD alongside an additional M.2 slot to further upgrade the storage post-purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real difference is in terms of graphics; all feature Nvidia RTX cards, but only the mid and top tier laptops feature Max-Q cards. The base model comes with the RTX 2060, while the mid-tier option boasts the RTX 2070 Max-Q and the top-tier sports the RTX 2080 Max-Q. If that’s not enough, you could always pick up Razer’s Core X eGPU to house a desktop card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, we’ve been testing the base model with a 9th-gen core i7, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU, and performance is what we’d expect from an entry-level RTX, although there are cheaper, more powerful options on the market if you can do without the Blade Pro 17’s sleek design.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Not long ago gaming laptops were big, bulky beasts that were more akin to a portable PC tower than a sexy, sleek laptop.

There are still plenty of similarities though, including the aluminium unibody and great build quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone is the stripe at the top of the rear, replaced by an antenna line which hugs the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MediaPad M5 8.4 review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lozenge-shaped fingerprint scanner stays below the screen on the front, though, and it works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MediaPad M5 comes in two colours - Champagne Gold and Space Grey – and brings everything up to date by replacing the microUSB port with a reversible USB-C port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as with many recent phones, the MediaPad M5 ditches the traditional headphone jack and bundles an adapter in the box so you don’t have to use USB-C headphones. It isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s frustrating considering the decision to remove the jack wasn’t because of waterproofing (there is none) or a lack of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the little USB-C to 3.5mm adapters are annoying, as they’re too easily lost or left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, there’s a nano-SIM slot for LTE so you can pop in a data SIM and get online when out of Wi-Fi range. If you need to, you can even insert a phone SIM (as opposed to data-only) and use the MediaPad like a giant phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that’s only on the SHT-AL09 model. There’s a Wi-Fi only version (model SHT-W09)and it’s unclear which regions will get which version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that the tablet will come in 32, 64 and 128GB versions, and all have a generous 4GB of RAM. They also have a microSD slot for adding up to 256GB of extra storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There’s an all-new design for the M5, and it no longer looks exactly like an scaled up Huawei Mate phone.

A 64GB model costs $499 and a 256GB model costs $649. Adding 4G LTE cellular to either adds $130. The Apple Pencil costs $99, and Apple’s keyboard case costs $159.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the 64GB model and the keyboard case, that gets you an “Apple laptop” for $658. The 11-inch iPad Pro and the MacBook Air, the least expensive Mac laptop, both cost at least $300 more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tablet’s design is a lot like the 2017 10.5-inch iPad Pro. It measures 9.8 by 6.8 by 0.2 inches (HWD) and weighs exactly one pound. There are dual speakers on the bottom, a Lightning (not USB-C) port, and a traditional home button with Touch ID. The Air doesn’t support Face ID, but Touch ID was very accurate and easy in testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2,224-by-1,668, 10.5-inch screen, meanwhile, is similar to the new iPad mini screen. The colors are quite accurate. Apple’s TrueTone technology changes the screen’s white point based on ambient light. We tested the screens with SpectraCal’s CalMAN for Business software and a Klein K-80 colorimeter, and found that both the iPad Air and iPad mini are about equally bright with TrueTone turned on, at 432 to 440 nits, but that the mini is brighter with TrueTone turned off, at 480 nits to the Air’s 451. Both are brighter than most smartphone screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery life is good, for an iPad. The Air lasted 6 hours, 13 minutes streaming a YouTube video with the screen set to full brightness over Wi-Fi, which is noticeably better than the fifth- and sixth-gen iPads, which lasted 5 hours, 40 minutes each. That translates to about eleven hours of use at half brightness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad Air also has the same networking capabilities as the iPad mini. That means a perfectly good 802.11ac Wi-Fi setup and an optional LTE modem that supports all US and most foreign networks. The Air has both an eSIM and a physical SIM card slot. Using the eSIM, you can sign up for plans on AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or various roaming carriers; you can use a physical SIM with Verizon or any other carrier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Air comes in gold, gray, or silver.
